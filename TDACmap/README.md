TDACmap.py - from a ThrEqualization.root file, picks out every pixel above a certain TDAC value and maps their locations.

To run this program, run the python file with 2 arguments:
1st argument should be the full path to ThrEqualization.root file
2nd argument should be the TDAC value at which the program picks out the pixels with higher TDAC value.
