noise-threshold.py - given ThrEqualization.root and SCurve.root files, picks out pixels with TDAC value above a set value then graphs the noise and threshold values for pixels above and below said TDAC value and compares them in a histogram.

To run this program, run the python file with 3 arguments:
1st argument should be the full path to the ThrEqualization.root file
2nd argument should be the cutoff TDAC value
3rd argument should be the SCurve.root file
